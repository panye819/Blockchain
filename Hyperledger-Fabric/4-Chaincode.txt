Channel:
  Allowing a group of participants to create a separate ledger of transactions.
  If two participants from a channel ,then those participants - and no others-
  have copies of the ledger for that channel.

Shared Ledger:
  Hyperledger Fabric has a ledger subsustem comprising two components:
    World state:
      Describe the state of the ledger at a given point in time.
      It is the database of the ledger.
    transaction log:
      Records all transactions which have resulted in the current value of the
      world state.
      It is the update history for the world state.

Smart Contracts
    Hyperledger Fabric Smart Contracts are written in chaincode and are invoked
    by an application external to the blockchain when that application nees to
    interact with the ledger.
    In most cases chaincode only interacts with the database component of the
    ledger,the world state(querying it ,e.g),and not the transaction log.

Privacy:
    Hyperledger Fabric supports networks where privacy(using channel) is a key
    operational requirement as well as networks that are comparetively open.

  SBFT(Simplified Byzantine Fault Tolerance)
