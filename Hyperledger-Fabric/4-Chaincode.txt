Chaincode:
  Chaincode is a program, written in Go, and eventually in other programming
  languages such as Java, that implements a prescribed interface. Chaincode runs
  in a secured Docker container isolated from the endorsing peer process.

  Chaincode initializes and manages ledger state through transactions submitted
  by applications.
