1、To limit the number of times that the same secret (or password) can be used
for enrollment, set the registry.maxenrollments in the configuration file to the
appropriate value. If you set the value to 1, the Fabric CA server allows
passwords to only be used once for a particular enrollment ID. If you set the
value to -1, the Fabric CA server places no limit on the number of times that
a secret can be reused for enrollment. The default value is -1. Setting the
value to 0, the Fabric CA server will disable enrollment for all identitiies
and registeration of identities will not be allowed.

2、The Fabric CA server should now be listening on port 7054.
